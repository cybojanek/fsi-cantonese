\subsection{Classroom Phrases}

\audioTag{A}{0:05}

The instructor will address you in Cantonese from the first day of class. The following are some instructions which you should learn to respond to. Look at your books while the instructor reads the phrases the first time. Then close your books, and the teacher will give the phrases several more times, using gestures to help you understand. Repease the phrases after him, mimicking his movements as well as his voice, to help you absorb the rhythm and meaning.
